When I look back on the past, if I don't remember what I did in the year even if just a little, it seems like I didn't try very hard at anything, which is very sad, so Iâ€™m going to write down quickly what I'v done so far on a yearly basis.

I'm writing down here with my short career and what I'd' like to do in the near future.

## Career history

**2018**: Started working as an IT engineer in April, but I didn't write any code and I was working as a help desk all the time.  
**2019**: Started programming. I was finally able to get a job writing code and worked all hours while learning.   
**2020**: Studied more programming and English, started getting job offers and started committing to GitHub as well.  
**2021**: Job Changing to [RareJob, inc](https://www.rarejob.co.jp/en) in June.  

## What I'd like to in the near future.

**The rest of 2021**: Focus on improving your English skills using [SMART Method](https://smartmethod.rarejob.com/) program, and I will get a good IELTS score next year in 2022. Because Because I'd like to be admitted to University of London offering Computer Science degree online and I need to demonstrate a good level of English to apply for that.
They say IELTS are accepted for all undergraduate courses, provided they have been awarded within the past three years, and require 6 overall, with 5.5 in each sub-test (Academic or General or IELTS Indicator Online Test).  
**2022**: Take IELTS in January, and apply for the earliest openings of the year for the University of London.

Although I have had a fulfilling career, but I regret not enrolling in university and I want to learn about computer science properly. I want to study computer science and get a degree through the wonderful means provided by Coursera and the University of London. This has been my goal for the past few years. I am almost there to make it come true.

I dare to write here in order to realize my goal. Backwater.
